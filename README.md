# Chinese Checkers
This is my final Java project for my diploma in Practical Software Engineering in Ort Hermelin Netanya.

Some 2 big mistakes when I made this project (due to lack of knowledge):
  1. I didn't use git.
  2. I didn't test my code.

But overall, the project was very educational so I have decided to upload it to my Github account.
I highly recommend to read the Powerpoint presentation and the PDF file and before checking the code itself.
